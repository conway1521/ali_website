I work on Inclusive Regional Economic Development for [Jobs for the Future](https://www.jff.org), a national US workforce and education organisation. In 2020, I graduated in Economics from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-doctorale/en/actualites/alessandro-conway-class-2020.html)'s Doctoral School in Paris as a Fulbright Scholar.

This website's purpose is to share my applied economic research work. You will find my projects below, including two novel tools: an interactive dashboard analysing the state of economic development in California, and a macroeconomic model studying the interaction between personal wellbeing and economic shocks.
