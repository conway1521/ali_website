I am a recent graduate in Economics from Sciences Po (Paris)'s Doctoral School, where I attended as a Fulbright Scholar. I focused on macroeconomics, inequality and modeling economies characterized by their wealth distributions using advanced computation. My goal now is to use research for informing public policies which improve socio-economic outcomes in the community around me, especially for those most vulnerable.

This website's purpose is to share my master's thesis project in the event that it benefits researchers and policymakers. I created a rigorous macroeconomic model to study the interaction between agents' personal wellbeing, as defined by social psychology, and economic shocks. See it in action below.
