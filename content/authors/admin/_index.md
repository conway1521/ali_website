I am a recent graduate in Economics from [Sciences Po (Paris)](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html)'s Doctoral School, where I attended as a Fulbright Scholar. I focused on macroeconomics, inequality and modeling economies characterized by their wealth distributions using advanced computation. My goal now is to use research for informing public policies which improve socio-economic outcomes in the community around me, especially for those most vulnerable.

This website's purpose is to share my applied economic research on improving quality of life. Researchers and policymakers, but also anyone, will find two novel evidence-based tools here: an interactive dashboard analysing the state of inclusive local economic development in California, and a macroeconomic model studying the interaction between agents' personal wellbeing and economic shocks. See them below!
