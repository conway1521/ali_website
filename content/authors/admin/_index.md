I am a recent graduate in Economics from Sciences Po (Paris)'s Doctoral School, where I attended as a Fulbright Scholar. I focused on macroeconomics, inequality and modeling economies characterized by their wealth distributions using advanced computation. My goal now is to use research for informing public policies which improve socio-economic outcomes in the community around me, especially for those most vulnerable.
