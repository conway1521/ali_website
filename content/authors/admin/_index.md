I am a Program Manager in the Inclusive Regional Economic Development unit of Jobs for the Future, a national US workforce and education organisation. Before that, I graduated in Economics from [Sciences Po (Paris)](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html)'s Doctoral School, where I attended as a Fulbright Scholar.

This website's purpose is to share my applied economic research on improving quality of life. Researchers and policymakers, but also anyone, will find two novel tools here: an interactive dashboard analysing the state of economic development in California, and a macroeconomic model studying the interaction between personal wellbeing and economic shocks. See them below!
