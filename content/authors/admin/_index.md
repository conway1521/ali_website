I am a recent graduate in Economics from Sciences Po (Paris)'s Doctoral School, where I attended as a Fulbright Scholar. I focused on macroeconomics and inequality, learning to model economies that are informed by a population's wealth distribution using advanced computation. My goal is to use these for informing policy which improves socio-economic outcomes in the community around me, especially those most vulnerable.
