In this post I rapidly describe the main reasons, methods and findings of my Master's Thesis. {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} See the full document {{< staticref "#publications" >}} here{{< /staticref >}}.

The purpose of this work was to question the foundational objectives driving economic policy decisions. In a context of increasing malcontent across the West, nations have so far been unable to adequately address the widespread rising inequality through standard tools.
