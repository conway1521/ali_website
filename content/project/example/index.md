In this post I rapidly describe the main motivations, research question and findings of my Master's Thesis. {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}}See the full document {{< staticref "#publications" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

The purpose of this work was to expand upon the foundational objectives driving economic policy decisions. In a context of rising inequality and malcontent across the West, evidence shows that standard economic indicators like GDP or consumption do not represent people's wellbeing effectively. In particular, {{< staticref "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3548365" "newtab" >}}this novel 2020 paper{{< /staticref >}} found that other determinants of personal welfare are increasingly 'decoupling' from people's material wealth. With significant new data collection efforts underway like the OECD's {{< staticref "https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org" "newtab" >}}Better Life Index{{< /staticref >}}, we now have the means to measure a larger, more complete version of wellbeing. __Therefore, I explored the possibility of including such an index, namely the SAGE frameworj, into a modern macroeconomic model that can analyze policy and other shocks.__

More specifically, The recognition of inequality and its subsequent inclusion in macroeconomic theory has led to new models that are informed by the wealth and income characteristics of (namely, Heterogeneous Agent models). These allow to study how policies or shocks affect people based on where they are in Yet, even the polcies employed follow   Beyond  Is there 

As a premise, I ask questions how appropriately economic models represent people. Does the standard notion of Utility level or, by extension, Consumption, really reflect a human being's health, life satisfaction and ? Do economic conditions such as unemployment, income and wealthIs this even relevant for informing economic policy? Research from two different angles has given a
