Fiscal policy is a significant lever for policymakers to influence the financial means of people. However, it can have drastically different implications given one's wealth and income-generating situation. Macroeconomic models have advanced significantly in recent times to be able to factor the financial heterogeneity of a population, and as always, improvements can always be made!

The point of this project is to identify the channels through which fiscal policy influences consumption among people of varying credit constraints through a novel method. Building upon [2021 research](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/rest_a_01094/106895/The-Distribution-of-Households-Indebtedness-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext) from Drs. Paul Hubert and Fergus Cumming, we connect individuals' asset liquidity with a unique fiscal policy dataset to estimate the specific consumption impacts on the heterogeneous actors. Estimating fiscal shock implications has not always been accurate (particularly in predicting them), and thus an alternative *Narrative approach* is employed to measure impulse responses.

Work in progress.
