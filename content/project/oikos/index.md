Well-before being the name of a popular yoghurt brand, the term *òikos* represented the basic unit of a society in ancient Greece– a household or family. The management of an *òikos* was termed *oikonomìa*, the origin of "economy". The study of a household in relation to its pyshicial and human environments is that of "ecology". More recently, “Oikos” has been used in sociology to define an indiviudal's social circle. Fast forward to today, the centrality of this ancient term is just as relevant to the essence of economic life: households in modern society manage their means and needs within our economic systems, the web of social networks, and local physical environment.

Yet our economic frameworks do not factor households’ full range of needs and relations. *Homo economicus* is modelled to behave rationally, optimally allocating consumption and leisure. But that’s been shown again and again to be only one part of the story.

On the news we continually hear of rising income and wealth inequality, of disenfranchised and marginalised populations, and of unequal access to opportunity. We are reminded daily of the fragility of our environment and the drastic consequences that changes are having on livelihoods, especially as those less-equipped to front them are most impacted.

Applied economic development work from community-based organisations, community colleges, workforce boards, local leaders and other direct service providers across the US elevate the foundational requirement of access to basic needs such as , of social networks, and of community engagement to and infrastructure for overcome barriers to resilient, shared prosperity. The ecosystem providing a scaffolding and onramp to economic development is social and human, in addition to economic.

Part of the reason why past and current economic models do not consider much of what has emerged from field-derived learning, is for ideological reasons and because of its sheer difficulty to implement theoretically (empirical evidence and mathematical proof are very important). *Yet traditional models have clearly not been succesful in yeilding equitable, sustainable, and resilient prosperity*. So, how can we engender **new** economic development models that promote growth while factoring these pluri-dimensional factors?

*Oikos* is a workstream that's being developed to fill this hole. Rooted in novel, rigorous economic and social science research as well as in the lived experience of communities, new evidence-based frameworks can show a way forward. Check out my most recent work, the [New Economic Development Dashboard](https://ned-dashboard.onrender.com), an interdisciplinary quantitative assessement tool for exploring economic development status along dimensions that better represent households' channels for equitable, durable development.
