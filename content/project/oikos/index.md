*Oikos* is a word that in Ancient Greece represented the basic unit of a society. Well before being used as a popular yoghurt brand, it signified a household. Its root, *oiko*, is also the root for "economy" and its derivatives. In our modern terms, it's time to understand the economy with households **in the full sense of the word** at its core.

Let's break down what that means:

On the news we continually hear of rising wealth inequality, disenfranchised populations, marginalised populations, and of unequal access to opportunity. We are reminded daily of the fragility of our environmental conditions and the drastic consequences changes are having on livelihoods, as well as how many who experience the worst outcomes are also those less-equipped to front them. 

Applied economic development work with community-based organisations, community colleges, workforce boards, and local leaders across the US elevate the foundational requirement of access to basic needs and  , and of community engagement to overcome barriers to resilient, shared prosperity. The ecosystem facilitating onramps to economic development across different regions is social and human, in addition to economic.

Past and current economic models do not consider much of what has emerged from field-derived learning, both for ideological reasons and because of its sheer difficulty (empirical evidence and mathematical proof are very important). *Yet traditional models have clearly not been succesful in yeilding equitable, sustainable, and resilient prosperity*. So, how can we engender **new** economic development models that promote growth while factoring these pluri-dimensional factors?

*Oikos* is a workstream that's being developed to fill this hole. Go check out my most recent work, the [New Economic Development Dashboard](https://ned-dashboard.onrender.com), where I show counties within state of California in terms of a novel framework that considers Place-based Conditions, Human and Social Capital, and Economic Activity.
