Well before being the brand of a popular yoghurt, the term *òikos* represented the basic unit of a society in ancient Greece– a household or family. The management of an *òikos* was termed *oikonomìa*, the etymological root of "economy". "Ecology" has a similar etymological derivation, namely the study of the household in relation to its pyshicial and human environments. In our modern terms, *Oikos* is used in sociology to define an indiviudal's social circle. While maybe not the original intent, this term regroups the essence of economic life of people in society: the management of a household's means as related to the web of social networks and local physical environment.

Let's see why placing households **in this full sense of their experience** at the core of the modern economy is important:

On the news we continually hear of rising income and wealth inequality, disenfranchised populations, marginalised populations, and of unequal access to opportunity. We are reminded daily of the fragility of our environment and the drastic consequences that changes are having on livelihoods, especially as those less-equipped to front them are most impacted.

Applied economic development work from community-based organisations, community colleges, workforce boards, local leaders and other direct service providers across the US elevate the foundational requirement of access to basic needs such as , of social networks, and of community engagement to overcome barriers to resilient, shared prosperity. The ecosystem facilitating onramps to economic development across different regions is social and human, in addition to economic.

Past and current economic models do not consider much of what has emerged from field-derived learning, both for ideological reasons and because of its sheer difficulty to implement theoretically (empirical evidence and mathematical proof are very important). *Yet traditional models have clearly not been succesful in yeilding equitable, sustainable, and resilient prosperity*. So, how can we engender **new** economic development models that promote growth while factoring these pluri-dimensional factors?

*Oikos* is a workstream that's being developed to fill this hole. Rooted in novel, rigorous economic and social science research as well as in the lived experience of communities, new evidence-based frameworks can show a way forward. Check out my most recent work, the [New Economic Development Dashboard](https://ned-dashboard.onrender.com), an interdisciplinary quantitative assessement tool for exploring economic development status along dimensions that better represent households' channels for equitable, durable development.
