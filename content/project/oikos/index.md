Well-before being the name of a popular yoghurt brand, *òikos* represented the basic unit of society in ancient Greece– a household. The management of an *òikos* was termed *oikonomìa*, the origin of "economy". The study of a household in relation to its pyshicial and human environments was the root of "ecology". More recently, *Oikos* has been used in sociology to define an indiviudal's social circle. The centrality of this ancient term showcases the essence of economic life: households to this day manage their means and needs within our economic systems, integrated in the web of social networks, and rooted in their local physical environment– an ecosystem (no points for guessing its root).

Yet our current economic frameworks do not factor households within any such ecosystem. *Homo economicus* is modelled as a rational household that optimally allocates consumption and leisure given budget and time constraints to match an underlying equilibrium of individual "utility", roughly "value". This has been shown again and again to be a misrepresentation.

On the news we continually hear of rising income and wealth inequality, of disenfranchised and marginalised populations, and of unequal access to the traditional forms of development (education, jobs). We are reminded daily of the fragility of our environment and of the drastic consequences that changes are having on livelihoods, especially as those less-equipped to front them are most impacted. Individual wellbeing is multifcated, but is quite clearly decoupling from material gain. All the while, our economies reach new heights of aggregated prosperity.

Applied economic development work from community-based organisations, community colleges, workforce boards, other direct service providers elevate the foundational role that basic needs, social networks, the access to these, and community engagement play in providing households the means to manage their livelihoods, and grow. They are also especially crucial for overcoming barriers to inclusive, shared prosperity. In other words, these crucial elements of the ecosystem providing support and onramps to economic development are social and human, not economic. 

Part of the reason why past and current economic models do not factor much of these (if any) is ideological, and another part because of its sheer difficulty (empirical evidence and mathematical proof are require good data and significant computing power, both lacking). *Yet these traditional models have not been succesful in yeilding equitable, sustainable, and resilient development*. So, how can we engender **new** economic development models that factor these pluri-dimensional factors while still promoting prosperity?

*Oikos* is a workstream that is being developed to fill this hole. Rooted in novel, rigorous economic and social science research as well as in the lived experience of communities, new evidence-based ecosystem frameworks can show a way forward. Check out my most recent work, the [New Economic Development Dashboard](https://ned-dashboard.onrender.com), an interdisciplinary quantitative assessement tool for exploring economic development status along dimensions that better represent households' enablers for equitable, durable development.
